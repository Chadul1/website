            Hello, My name is Chad, and this is my website. 
            I'm  21 years old (as of 2023), and I've been all over the country. I was born in 2002 in Stevens Point Wisconsin. 
            And nearly immediately my family moved to Canada as my father was working to earn an associates degree in Theology. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After he finished that, we moved to Kalispell, Montana, this is where most of my siblings were born and grown.
            In 2014, my father lost his job as a waiter and we moved back to Wisconsin to care for my grandmother. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I was Home-Schooled for a majority of my life, and when I graduated from highschool.
            I wasn't really sure of what I wanted to do, I bounced between minimum wage jobs looking for something. 
            After about three years, and two false starts in further education. I worked in a paper-mill that was based out of Stevens Point. 
            After working for 6 months, I suddenly had the motivation to go into further education.

        <article class="hidden" id="left-aside"> 
            My first few experiences with further education was met with apathy.
            I was doing it because i had felt that my parents expected it of me, which isn't a good as me wanting to go to learn a trade or want to go into a chosen field.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'd always wanted to go into programming, as I grew up on the internet and playing video-games with friends made up a lot of my childhood. 
            <br>
            Long story short, I didn't put in the work and I flunked out twice. Then I took a break where I lived alone in a apartment and worked a job to help pay the bills. 
            <br>
            <br>
            It was during this time that I quickly realized that I didn't want to live paycheck to paycheck, barely squeaking by at the end of every month as well as working in a paper-mill taught me the importance of further education.
            <br>
            <br>
            I worked out the rest of my apartment lease and moved into the dorms and as of 2023, I've completed 2 semesters worth of credits. Working over the summer and fall to catch up and recover my bad GPA.
            I'm moving into my third semester of schooling and I'm hoping to invest that time into furthering my education and readying myself for my career into Software Development.

            <img src="../Images/Hobbies.png" alt="An image containing a man editing, a series of dice used in table-top games, and typewriting.">
            I have a scatterbrain approach to my hobbies. Choosing between whatever catches my interest, putting one down and coming back to it later. 
            <br>
            <br>
            One of my largest time sinks is gaming, I love game design in online-video-games, board games, card games and most of all, Table-Top Role-Playing Games.
            <br>
            Investigating why things work, why players liked or disliked something in a game, what appeals to the niche's in gaming and how human's react to mechanics is a very interesting discussion to me. 
            Something else I find interesting is storytelling and Video Editing. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I've always enjoyed writing, It's a hobby of mine that predates playing video-games. I've always loved reading books, and writing the stories that were inspired from them, and they were all terrible. 
            <br>
            Not that will stop me, writing is something I've found to be an enjoyable experience, 
            and something that I'll always be working on. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I also dabble in video editing, not that I've done a lot of it, but I've always had an idea for an episodic video series where I mess around with the ideas I have. 
            Dialogue is the worst part for me though, I've never been good at writing dialogue, which funnily enough is usually the majority of written stories.

                <li>
                    <h2>The Andes Mountains in Argentina</h2>
                    One of my friends told me about his home country of Argentina.
                    <br> which holds a lot of similarities to what I consider my home state in Montana.
                    It'll always be one of the few places in the world I'd like to visit, and if I like it enough, stay there. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h2>Mountain Goats overlooking Glacier National Park</h2>
                    The first place I ever really grew up in was in Montana, in a little city named Kalispell. 
                    <br> And I think a part of me never left that sleepy town.
                    One of my most fond memories of the state is when my family dragged me to Glacier National Park, 
                    where I saw massive goats, and big horned sheep traveling along the high up peaks of the Rocky Mountains. 
                    <br>
                    I'd like to go there again someday, maybe live there so I can see the mountains in the distance.  
                </li>
                    <br>
                <li>
                    <h2>A photo from a peak in the Appalachians</h2>
                    As much as I've looked west to the Rocky Mountains, I'd look equally as hard to the east to the Appalachian Mountains, 
                    and the Appalachian Trail that travels nearly the entire length of the mountains in the United States. 
                    <br>
                    Ever since I read "A walk in the Woods" by Bill Bryson, it's always been a pipedream of mine to walk the trail in parts, hiking along for a few days and then meeting someone to travel back home. 
                    <br>
                    Maybe when I've got a career on lock and will have the money so I could actually afford the ordeal, I'll go and do it.

                <li>
                    <h2>City Street of Tokyo, Japan.</h2>
                    If you ask me, probably one of the most interesting places in the world culturally is Japan. 
                    There's so much stuff going on in that country, and It makes me think about how much of the world I don't know about. 
                    <br>
                    The customs, traditions and folklore of Japan has always interested me, the language and it's intricacies, as well as the dress will always have me put it on the map as a travel destination.
